```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Q1

1. Compute the mean, median, 90th percentile, and standard deviation of the number of arrival delay minutes of RegionExâ€™s flights. Do the same for MDA's flights. How do the two airlines compare?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
d <- read_csv("flight_delay.csv")
glimpse(d)


table(d$Airline)

d <- d %>% 
  mutate(delay = as.numeric(`Arrival delay in minutes`)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(delay))

summary(d)

d  %>% 
  group_by(Airline) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            avg_delay = mean(delay, na.rm=T),
            median_delay = median(delay, na.rm=T),
            p90 = quantile(delay, probs=c(.9), na.rm=T),
            sd = sd(delay, na.rm=T)) 
```

## Q2

Visualize delay. High outliers but typical performance is better.

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(delay)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~Airline)
```
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
